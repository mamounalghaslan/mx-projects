# Model training

### For use on a _Linux_ machine

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook files with the results of training for YOLOv5, v7, and v8.
All files should run smoothly if Python 3.7 is installed with `pip install utils` in the environment.

The paths in the files need to be updated to point to the correct locations.
