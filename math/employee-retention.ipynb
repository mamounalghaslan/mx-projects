    "1. **Identify Outliers**: Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the data. Depending on the nature of the data and the problem we are solving, we will decide on a technique for handling those outliers. While removing them might be the simple and easy way, transforming them, or treating them as special cases might derive important insights.\n",
    "2. **Data Transformation and Standardization**: Some attributes might be of different scales. Thus, standardization is useful in this case.\n",
    "3. **Reclassifying Categorical Variables**: Identify any categorical variables that need to be transformed or processed to make them suitable for analysis or modeling.\n",
    "4. **Binning Numerical Variables**: Determine whether it is valuable to bin or categorize numerical variables, which uncover patterns that might not be visible with continuous data.\n",
    "5. **Adding an Index Field**: Based on the dataset, it might be useful to add an index field for each employee, which makes it easier to track records.\n",
    "6. **Handling Missing Data**: Determine a strategy to handle missing values, which may involve replacing them with estimated values or removing records with missing values.\n"
